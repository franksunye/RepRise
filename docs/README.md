# RepRise — Documentation

This `docs` folder is a place to collect project-level documentation. Ideas for content:

- Architecture overview
- Frontend (`/frontend`) usage and deploy notes (Vercel)
- Backend/API contract (if any)
- Development workflow and contributor guide

Quickstart

1. Frontend: see `frontend/README.md` for local development and Vercel deploy steps.
2. To edit this doc, create a branch, make changes, and open a pull request.

Notes

- This repository currently has a `feat/frontend-starter` branch that contains a Next.js starter in `frontend`.
- You can import the project into Vercel and set the project root to `frontend` to deploy the frontend app.
