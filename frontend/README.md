# RepRise Frontend (Next.js starter)

This folder contains a minimal Next.js (app router) + TypeScript + Tailwind starter template.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
npm run start
```

Deploy to Vercel:

- Sign in to Vercel and import the project repository. Vercel detects Next.js automatically. Use the root `frontend` folder as the project root if you imported the repository root.
- The default build command is `npm run build` and the output directory is handled automatically by Next.js.

Notes:
- This template uses the Next.js `app` router and Tailwind CSS. To enable Tailwind you must run `npm install` first (tailwind and postcss are included in devDependencies).
- If you want me to install dependencies now or create a Git commit and push the new files, tell me and I will do it.
